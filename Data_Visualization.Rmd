# Data Visualization 

### 3.1 Introduction

```{r}
# We must load the tidyverse library every session

library(tidyverse)
```

### 3.2 First Steps

QUESTION: Do cars with big engines use more gas than cars with small engines? 

##### 3.2.1 mpg Data Frame

A data frame is a rectangular collection of variables (in the columns) and observations (in the rows). mpg contains observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on 38 models of car. 



### 3.2.2 Creating a ggplot

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ , y = hwy)) 

# The ggplot function creates a scatter plot and that is our bottom layer. The geom_point function allows for us to actually map the data that we have 
```
##### Exercises
> 1. Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see?

> 2. How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?

> 3. What does the drv variable describe? Read the help for ?mpg to find out.

> 4. Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.

> 5. What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?

1.
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)
```
> I see just a blank coordinate grid. I think this is because we do not have our geom_point function to map the points within the grid. 

2. 
```{r}
mpg
```
> There are 234 rows and 11 columns in the dataframe mpg. 
3. 
```{r}
?mpg
```

> The drv variable describes the type of drive train, with f being front wheel drive, r being rear wheel drive, and 4 being 4 wheel drive. 





4. 
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg) + geom_point (mapping = aes (x = hwy , y = cyl))
```

5. 
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point (mapping = aes(x = class , y = drv ))
```
> Answer: This plot is not useful because there seems to be no correlation between the two, because both of the variables are qualitative and thus we can discover nothing quantitative about the car. However, we can discover which types of cars do not have any different drv models. 

### 3.3 Aesthetic Mappings

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ , y = hwy , color = class))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ,y = hwy , size = class))
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes( x = displ , y = hwy , alpha = class))
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ , y = hwy , shape = class))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes (x = displ, y = hwy, color = class , shape = class))
```

##### 3.3.1 Exercises 

> 1. What's wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?

Answer: The points are not blue because the color aesthetic needs to be mapped to a variable, such as hwy or displ. I assume that the first color allocation in RStudio is red, and the function created a variable named "blue" which encompasses every point in the (x,y) dataframe. 


> 2. Which variables in mpg are categorical? Which variables are continuous? 

Categorical variables are: manufacturer, model, drv, class, fl, 

Continuous variables are: cty, hwy, displ, year 

> 3. Map a continuous variable to color, size, and shape. How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables? 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy , color = cyl))

```
A continous variable cannot be mapped to shape because there are infinitely many possible inputs because it is a number. Also, for the color function, it turns the points into more and less transparent points of the same color because all cars do have a cylinder, but it is the size to which they differ that the transparency is mapping. The graph is "continously" blue. 

> 4. What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics? 
 
 It usually maps it together, if they can correspond with one another. Color and shape will both map concurrently. 

> 5. What does the stroke aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? 

> 6. What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like aes(colour = displ < 5)? Note, youâ€™ll also need to specify x and y. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ , y = hwy , color = displ < 5))
```

### 3.5 Facets


```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes (x = displ, y = hwy)) + facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
```

## 3.5 Exercises

> 1. What happens if you facet a continouos variable?'

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + facet_wrap(~ cty , nrow = 10)
```
It just produces a bunch of different small plots for all the different quantities of city mileage. It does show how many cars have which city mileage, but besides that it is not very helpful.


> 2. What do the empty cells in plot with facet_grid( drv ~ cyl) represent? 

They represent the fact that some combinations of the car's drive and it's number of cylinders are not posessed by any car models in the dataframe.

> 3. What plot does the following code make? What does . do?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ .)

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ cyl)
```
It makes two different facet wrap functions for two different categorical variables. I believe that the . causes one of the sections of the facet_grid to just be blank and hence this just makes it the same as a facet_wrap function as far as I know, but the categorical variables can be plotted vertically now. 

> 4. Take the first faceted plot in this section. What are the advantages to using faceting instead of color aesthetic? 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```
It allows us to more clearly seperate our data into different grids to more clearly paint the picture of different trends between a car's engine displacement and highway mileage, with its type of car. It is much more seperate and easier to decipher in this case than a color aesthetic which would just have one big plot with a jumble of different colors. Facets allow us to the see the subtrends of each of the different car types. 

> 5. Read ?facet_wrap. What does nrow do? What other options control the layout of the panels? Why doesn't facet_grid have nrow and ncol arguments? 

```{r}
?facet_wrap
```
It controls the number of rows of plots that will be displayed. So if nrow = 2, then we will have two rows of subplots of the data. 

> 6. When using facet_grid() you should usually put the variables with more unique levels in the columns. Why? 

Because the variable that has more unique levels will hinder the data if plotted horizontally. In our example above, we can still see trends in the data when we put the drv on the column but that may not be so if we plotted it in the row.We have more space horizontally than vertically, so whichever variables have the least number of different types should be put on the columns.  

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + facet_grid(cyl ~ cty)
```

### 3.6 Geometric Objects 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype = drv))
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ , y = hwy , group = drv))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy , color = drv))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + geom_smooth() + geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class))
```

## Exercises 1-5 Only 

> 1. What geom would you use to draw a line chart? A boxplot? A histogram? An area chart?

For a line chart, geom_smooth produces a line of best fit for a given (x,y) frame of data. For a boxplot, we have geom_boxplot, and then geom_histogram, and geom_area. 

> 2. Run this code in your head and then run it on R to check your predictions about it. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```
It takes out the gray area that presents the margin of error of a line. I think that 'se' stands for 'standard error' of the line chart, and that is false in the code chunk above, so it does not show that area. For everything else, the color is mapped to the ggplot() so both the point and smooth functions have color associations.

> 3. What does show.legend = FALSE do? What happens if you remove it?
Why do you think I used it earlier in the chapter?

I believe that no legend would show up on the plot. We like the legend though because it presents us with the different associations between lines, points with color.

> 4. What does the se argument to geom_smooth() do? 

It represents the standard error of the geom_smooth line function. So, it shows us the margin of error of the line, and without it, there is no gray area on the plot.

> 5. Will the two graphs look different? Why/why not?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()

ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_smooth(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

No, they look the same, it is just different appearances in the code chunk. For one, the ggplot() function globally maps the dataframe for the geom_point functions, and for the other, ggplot() is left blank and the data has to be mapped to each geom individually. I think that the top one is smoother because it does not repeat the code over again. 

### 3.7 Statistical Transformations
```{r}
?diamonds
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```

```{r}
?geom_bar
```


### 3.8 Position Adjustments


```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = cut))
```







```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity))
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity)) + geom_bar(alpha = 0.2, position = "Identity")
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, color = clarity)) + geom_bar(fill = NA, position = "identity")
```



```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity)) + geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity)) + geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ , y = hwy)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.3)
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + geom_point(position = "jitter")
```

##### 3.8.1 Exercises

Notebook Check - Checking for all the exercises and the notes. 

Project starting next week, and due the week after


> 1. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()
  
```
A: The problem with this plot is that all the points line up too perfectly and this plot does not actually have every datapoint on the graph. The data is "too tidy" 


> 2. What parameters to geom_jitter() control the amount of jittering? 

```{r}
?geom_jitter
```

A: The "width" of the jitter controls the amount of jittering. 


> 3. Compare and contrast geom_jitter() with geom_count() 

```{r}
?geom_count
```

A: geom_count will actually count the number of overlapping points and display the numerical value of each point to the viewer, whereas geom_jitter will show all of the points by jittering them next to each other. 


> 4. What is the default position adjustment for geom_boxplot()? Create a visualization of the mpg dataset that represents it? 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = hwy))
```

A: The default position adjustment for geom_boxplot is position_dodge().
